You are creating an application to manage event bookings.
An array contains event details:
const events = [
{ name: 'Music Fest', date: '2024-12-01', ticketsSold: 500, maxTickets: 1000 },
{ name: 'Tech Conference', date: '2024-11-25', ticketsSold: 200, maxTickets: 300 },
{ name: 'Food Expo', date: '2024-12-10', ticketsSold: 750, maxTickets: 750 },
{ name: 'Art Fair', date: '2024-11-20', ticketsSold: 100, maxTickets: 200 },
];
Tasks:
-Find events that are sold out.
-Calculate the total number of tickets sold across all events.
-Sort the events by the percentage of tickets sold in descending order.
Add a new field remainingTickets to each event, indicating the number of tickets left.
-Return events happening after a specific date (e.g.,
'2024-11-30' )
